# 0450 Governance Rollout

As important aspect of the governance program is the
ability to measure its effectiveness and identify the
assets that are delivering the highest value, or operating with the greatest efficiency etc.

A value that should be measured is documented using the
**GovernanceMetric** entity.  It is linked to the appropriate
[GovernanceDefinition](0401-Governance-Definitions.md)
and can be linked to a [data set](0010-Base-Model.md) where the measurements are
being gathered.

Alternatively specific metadata elements can
be associated with their measurements via the
**GovernanceMeasurements** classification.
