# Using Egeria's REST APIs

Egeria supports REST APIs for making synchronous (request-response) calls between
OMAG Servers and between clients and OMAG Servers.

The REST APIs are usable directly for calling from non-Java platforms.
However they are designed for the internal use of Egeria and are not guaranteed to be
backwards compatible.

## 

The structure of the URL for an Egeria REST API varies lightly depending on whether
it is a call to an OMAG Server Platform service or an OMAG Server service.
