# Why is this project called "Egeria"?

![Egeria Logo](../../../assets/img/egeria2.png#pagewidth)

The ideas behind Egeria came from the project founders' extensive work in
building big data solutions.  At that time, these were
often called **data lakes** or **data reservoirs**.

This publication 
[The Journey Continues: From Data Lake to Data-Driven Organization](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp5486.pdf)
described the need for open metadata.

The original plan was to extend [Apache Atlas](http://atlas.apache.org)
to support the open metadata protocols.  However, the open metadata function
proved too big to be an add-on to Atlas and we agreed with the
Atlas team to start a new project for open metadata.

Then there was the question of what to call the new project.
The name needed to be available for trademark and a member of the
community came up with "Egeria".

Egeria was a Roman Water Nymph and a wise counselor.
(See [Wikipedia for more details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egeria_%28mythology%29 )).
The water theme seemed to fit with the data lake origin and since
the Egeria technology shares knowledge between communities that
use different tools, the notion of a "counselor" seemed to fit as well.

The new Egeria project needed a foundation to host the repositories
and provide the open governance support to ensure that people can
use and work on the project irrespective of their organizational affiliation.

The Linux's Foundation's ODPi foundation offered a home for Egeria and the
project thrived under its guidance.

In October 2020, the ODPi and another foundation from the Linux Foundation
called the LF AI agreed to merge into a new foundation called the
[LF AI and Data](https://lfaidata.foundation/).  This foundation has
brought together a valuable collection of projects that spans data management
and a wide range of analytics capability.
