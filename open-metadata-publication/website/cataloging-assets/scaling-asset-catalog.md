# Scaling the asset catalog through automation

Automation is critical when it comes to managing an asset catalog.
It reduces the administrative work of subject matter experts and asset owners,
increases the reliability, reach and richness of the asset catalog whilst
reducing the cost of its maintenance.

Some automation is easy and reliable, particularly for information that can be extracted
directly from the digital technologies used to implement the assets.
Other automation involves analytics to create a candidate result that may need to be
confirmed and approved by a subject matter expert.  However, even when this human validation
is necessary, the effort required is significantly less that manual maintenance of the catalog. 

Whenever subject matter experts are involved, it typically requires a change to their role
in order to accommodate the time spent on the catalog.
Often these experts are from a different part of the
organization to the people receiving the benefit of their expertise, and so the organization's
appreciation and use of the asset catalog needs to have matured to allow this to happen.

Therefore as we look at the different types of automation, each comes with
its own organizational maturity required to make it successful.

## What automation is possible?

Egeria offers the following approaches to cataloging assets:

* [Manual cataloging](manual-cataloging.md) - calling the access services to set up each asset.
* [Templated cataloging](templated-cataloging.md) - copying predefined assets.
* [Integrated cataloging](integrated-cataloging.md) - automated extraction of metadata from third party technologies.
* [Discovery and stewardship](discovery-and-stewardship.md) - analysis of asset contents to create metadata

The idea is that these approaches are selected for each type of asset and blended together to balance
the investment in the automation, against the time commitment of subject matter experts, against
the business value of the resulting catalog.
