### When does a maintainer lose maintainer status

If a maintainer is no longer interested or cannot perform the maintainer duties listed above, they
should volunteer to be moved to emeritus status. In extreme cases this can also occur by a vote of
the maintainers per the voting process below.

## Lead

The project maintainers will elect a lead ( and optionally a co-lead ) which will be the primary point of contact for the project and representative to the TSC. The lead(s) will be responsible for the overall project health and direction, coordination of activities, and working with other projects and committees as needed for the continuted growth of the project.

* TBD

# Conflict resolution and voting

In general, we prefer that technical issues and maintainer membership are amicably worked out
between the persons involved. If a dispute cannot be decided independently, the maintainers can be
called in to decide an issue. If the maintainers themselves cannot decide an issue, the issue will
be resolved by voting. The voting process is a simple majority in which each maintainer receives one vote.
