# ODPi Calypso - Open Metadata and Governance

ODPi Calypso provides the Apache 2.0 licensed open metadata and governance type system, frameworks, APIs, event payloads and interchange protocols to enable tools, engines and platforms to exchange metadata in order to get the best value from data whilst ensuring it is properly governed.  More information on open metadata and governance can be found here: https://odpi.github.io/data-governance/Open-Metadata-and-Governance.

## Calypso content organization

The Calypso content is organized into five modules:

* **developer-resources** - contains useful files and documentation for a calypso developer.
* **open-metadata-implementation** - implementation of standards, frameworks and connectors.
* **open-metadata-compliance-suite** - implementation of the tests that determine if a vendor
or open source technology is compliant with the open metadata and governance standards.
* **open-metadata-demos** - provides demonstrations of the open metadata standards to
prove out their capabilities and provide education for newcomers.
* **open-metadata-distribution** - contains scripts to extract the completed artifacts from
the other modules and stores them together to make it easy to find them.
* **open-metadata-publication** - contains scripts that send artifacts collected together by the
open-metadata-distribution module to external parties. 

This content is maintained by the Calypso community.  To understand how to join and contribute see the [Community Guide](https://github.com/odpi/calypso/CONTRIBUTING.md).
