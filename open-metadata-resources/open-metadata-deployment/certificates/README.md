### Additional Notes 
####Building diagrams

Rendered image files are checked in, however when updating, the diagrams can be regenerated using ![PlantUML](https://plantuml.com)
 
For example, with access to the plantuml jar:
`java -jar plantuml.jar <FILE>` 

or in a MacOS HomeBrew install: 
`plantuml -tpng ssl-oneway.puml` 

The diagrams can be rendered to svg, however notes are not rendered so clearly. However the image can be zoomed.
