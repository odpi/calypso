# Egeria helm charts for Kubernetes

This directory contains the 'lab' helm chart which creates a tutorial environment intended to show how
Egeria can be used to support the metadata needs of a small, hypothetical, pharmaceutical company known
as Coco Pharmecuticals

Please refer to [odpi-egeria-lab/README.md] for more detailed information

Other helm charts can be found in the new egeria-samples respository at https://github.com/odpi/egeria-samples/helm-charts

See also the https://github.com/odpi/egeria-k8s-operator repository for an alternative approach to kubernetes deployment
