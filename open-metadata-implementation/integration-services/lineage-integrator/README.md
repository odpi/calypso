# Lineage Integrator Open Metadata Integration Service (OMIS)

The Lineage Integrator integration service supports the loading lineage information
from a third party technology.  Specifically this include process structure, ports,
schemas and the data assets they are working with.

The modules are as follows:

* [lineage-integrator-api](lineage-integrator-api) - defines the interface for an integration
connector that is supported by the Lineage Integrator integration service. This includes the implementation
of the context that wraps the Asset Manager OMAS's clients.

* [lineage-integrator-server](lineage-integrator-server) - implements the context manager for
the Lineage Integrator integration service.

This integration service is paired with the [Asset Manager](../../access-services/asset-manager)
Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS).
