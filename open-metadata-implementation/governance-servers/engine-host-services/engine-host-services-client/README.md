# Asset Analysis Engine Services Client

The asset analysis engine services client module contains the client
implementation of the calls to the discovery engine
that request that a particular
[open discovery service](../../../frameworks/open-discovery-framework/docs/discovery-service.md)
is run against an Asset.

It also supports the ability to query the status of such a discovery request and
retrieve the resulting 
[discovery analysis report](../../../frameworks/open-discovery-framework/docs/discovery-analysis-report.md).
