# Open Lineage API

The Open Lineage Services API  module provides the property structures and
REST structures used to drive the open lineage.

- [Beans](docs/beans/README.md)
- [Exceptions](docs/exceptions/REAMDE.md)

This module also defines the interfaces that need to be implemented in order for a graph connector to integrate through OLS.

In essence these are the following:

- a graph connector provider, implemented by extending `LineageGraphProviderBase`.
- a graph connector, implemented by extending `LineageGraphConnectorBase`.

The methods in LineageGraphProviderBase need to be overridden to implement those set / retrieval operations according to the specifics of 
the graph database used. 
Currently, the only implementation available for the connector is the
[open-lineage-janus-connector](../../../adapters/open-connectors/governance-daemon-connectors/open-lineage-connectors/open-lineage-janus-connector/README.md)
