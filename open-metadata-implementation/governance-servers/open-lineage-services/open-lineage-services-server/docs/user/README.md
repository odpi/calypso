# Open Lineage Services Server REST Interface

The OLS REST services use a URL that begins

```

<serverRootURL>/servers/{serverName}/open-metadata/open-lineage/users/{userId}
```

where:
* **serverName** is the name of the server
* **userId** is the userId of the person (or server) making the call

The specific REST API for OLS extends this basic URL

## get lineage for entity

* [get lineage](get-lineage-with-rest.md)
