# Governance Action Service

A governance action service is a specialized [connector](../../open-connector-framework/docs/concepts/connector.md)
that performs monitoring of metadata changes, validation of metadata, triage of issues, assessment and/or remediation activities on request.

There are five types of governance action services:
  
* **Watchdog Governance Service Service** listens for changes to metadata and initiates
  [governance actions](governance-action.md), [governance action processes](governance-action-process.md)
  or an [incident report](incident-report.md).
  
* **Verification Governance Action Service** validates that the metadata elements, relationships and
  classification are set up as they should be.  For example, it may check that a new asset has an owner, is set up
  with zones and includes a connection and a schema there possible.  It produces [guards](guard.md)
  that define what needs to be done.
  
* **Triage Governance Action Service** runs triage rules to determine how to manage a situation or request.
  Often this involves a human decision maker.   It may initiate an external workflow, wait for manual
  decision or create a **To Do** for a specific person.
  
* **Remediation Governance Action Service** makes updates to metadata elements, relationships between them
  and classifications. Examples of remediation governance action services are duplicate linking and consolidating.

* **Provisioning Governance Action Service**  invokes a provisioning service whenever a provisioning request is made. 
  Typically the provisioning service is an external service.  It may also create lineage metadata to
  describe the work of the provisioning engine.
