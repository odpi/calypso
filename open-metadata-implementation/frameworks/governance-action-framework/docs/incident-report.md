# Incident Report

An incident report describes a situation that is out of line with the governance
definitions (such as policies and rules).  It provides a focus point to
coordinate efforts to resolve the situation.

As the incident is handled, details of the cause, affected resources
and actions taken are attached to the incident report to create
a complete record of the incident for future analysis.

Incident reports are typically created by
[Governance Watchdog Services](watchdog-governance-service.md).


## Open metadata types

[0470 Incident Reporting](../../../../open-metadata-publication/website/open-metadata-types/0470-Incident-Reporting.md)
shows the structure of the incident report.
It is a [Referenceable](../../../../open-metadata-publication/website/open-metadata-types/0010-Base-Model.md)
so it can support comments and linked classifications and tags.
