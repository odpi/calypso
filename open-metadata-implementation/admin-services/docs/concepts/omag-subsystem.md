# Open Metadata and Governance Subsystems

A subsystem is a collection of components
within a software server that supports one or more related services.
Subsystems can be organized in a hierarchy where course-grained subsystems can be
decomposed into more fine grained subsystems.

The [OMAG Server](omag-server.md) is a flexible software server whose subsystems
can be activated (or not) through the presence (or absence) of the subsystem's configuration
properties in the OMAG server's [configuration document](configuration-document.md).

The potential subsystems within an [OMAG Server](omag-server.md) are as follows:

* **[Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS)](../../../repository-services)** for supporting access
  to metadata stored in metadata repositories and the exchange of metadata between repositories
  via an [open metadata repository cohort](../../../repository-services/docs/open-metadata-repository-cohort.md).
  The repository services are further divided into five subsystems that can be activated independently.
  However the OMRS Administration services are present in every server.
  
  * **[Administration Services](../../../repository-services/docs/subsystem-descriptions/administration-services.md)** drive the
    initialization of the OMRS at server startup, provide access to the OMRS's internal status and
    coordinate the orderly termination of OMRS when the server
    is deactivated.  It also manges the audit log destinations for all servers and
    the loading of metadata archives into [metadata servers](metadata-server.png).
    
  * **[Enterprise Repository Services](../../../repository-services/docs/subsystem-descriptions/enterprise-repository-services.md)** provides a virtual
    metadata repository by combining the content of multiple open metadata
    repositories and delivering this metadata through a single API and event topic.
    The Enterprise Repository Services provide the enterprise access metadata support for the OMASs.
    
    * **[Cohort Services](../../../repository-services/docs/subsystem-descriptions/cohort-services.md)** manage the local
    server's membership in one or more open metadata repository cohorts.
    
    * **[Local Repository Services](../../../repository-services/docs/subsystem-descriptions/local-repository-services.md)** manage the local
    server's open metadata repository.
  
    * **[Event Management Services](../../../repository-services/docs/subsystem-descriptions/event-management-services.md)** manage the flow of OMRS Events
    between the other OMRS subsystems.

  
* **[Integration Daemon Services](../../../governance-servers/integration-daemon-services)** for running integration
  connectors that exchange metadata with third party
  technologies.
  
* **[Connected Asset Services](../../../common-services/ocf-metadata-management)** for supporting the ConnectedAsset interface of a connector.  

* Dynamically registered services provide specialist APIs for particular technologies and user roles.
  Each of these services runs in their own subsystem independent of the
  other registered services. 
  The implementation may come from Egeria or a third party. The links are to Egeria provided dynamic services.
  
    * **[Open Metadata Access Services (OMAS)](../../../access-services)** for supporting domain-specific services
      for metadata access and governance.  Access services run in the [Metadata Server](metadata-server.md) and
      [Metadata Access Point](metadata-access-point.md) server.
            
    * **[Open Metadata Engine Services (OMES)](../../../engine-services)** for supporting specialized governance
      engines that drive governance activity in the open metadata ecosystem.
      The engine services run in the [Engine Host](engine-host.md) server.
    
    * **[Open Metadata Integration Services (OMIS)](../../../integration-services)** for supporting
    specific types of
    [integration connectors](../../../governance-servers/integration-daemon-services/docs/integration-connector.md).
    The integration services run in the [integration daemon](integration-daemon.md) server. 
    
    * **[Open Metadata View Services (OMVS)](../../../view-services)** for supporting REST
    services for a User Interface (UI).  The view services run in a
    [View Server](view-server.md).
