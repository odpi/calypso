# Governance Servers

Governance servers host specific integration or
governance connectors for technology that does
not integrate directly with open metadata.

![Governance Server](governance-server.png#pagewidth)

These are the different types:

* **[Engine Hosts](engine-host.md)** - hosts governance engines for active management of the open metadata ecosystem.

* **[Integration Daemons](integration-daemon.md)** manages the exchange of metadata with third party technologies.

* **[Data Engine Proxy](data-engine-proxy.md)** - captures information about processes and the data sources that they work with and catalogs them in open metadata.

* **[Open Lineage Server](open-lineage-server.md)** - accumulates lineage information to provide a comprehensive historical reporting service for lineage.
