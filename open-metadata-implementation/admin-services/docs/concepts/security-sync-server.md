# Security Sync Server

The Security Sync Server is a deprecated governance server.  The equivalent function runs as the
[Security Integrator Open Metadata Integration Service (OMIS)](../../../integration-services/security-integrator)
in an [Integration Daemon](integration-daemon.md).
It is responsible for keeping a security
enforcement engine supplied with the latest metadata settings.

The Security Integrator OMIS is paired with the 
[Asset Manager OMAS](../../../access-services/asset-manager).
