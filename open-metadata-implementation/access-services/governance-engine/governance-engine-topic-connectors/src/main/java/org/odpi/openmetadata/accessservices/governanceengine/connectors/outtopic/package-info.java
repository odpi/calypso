/**
 * The governance engine connectors are the interfaces of the
 * connectors supported by the Governance Engine OMAS.
 *
 * Currently there are two connectors, one for the client
 * and one for the server, that are used to exchange events
 * over the Governance Engine OMAS's out topic.
 *
 * There are two connectors because events should only flow one way
 * and so the client needs a different interface to the server.
 *
 * Specifically the client interface is a listener interface
 * to allow the client to receive events from the server.
 * The server interface is an event sending interface.
 *
 * If the Governance Engine OMAS supported an in topic,
 * there would be two additional connectors: a listening type
 * interface for the server and a sending type
 * interface for the client.
