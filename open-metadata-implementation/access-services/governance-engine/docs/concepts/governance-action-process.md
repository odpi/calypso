# Governance Action Process

A governance action process is a predefined sequence of
[governance actions](governance-action.md) that are coordinated by
the [Governance Engine OMAS](../..).

The steps in a governance action process are defined by linked [governance action types](governance-action-type.md).
Each governance action type provides the specification of the governance action to run.
The links between then show which guards cause the governance action to run.

Details of how to set up governance action process is described in the 
[Governance Engine OMAS User Guide](../user).
