# Configuring the Asset Lineage OMAS


The Asset Lineage OMAS can be activated in an OMAG Server that has the Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS)
[Enterprise Repository Services](../../../../../repository-services/docs/subsystem-descriptions/enterprise-repository-services.md)
enabled.

For the Asset Lineage Open Metadata Access Service configuration, the example from [the Open Metadata Access Services](../../../../../admin-services/docs/user/configuring-the-access-services.md)
can be used. In order to enable only this access service on the server, "asset-lineage" should be provided for the endpoint available at the access-service level.

This OMAS supports the configuration of the specific list of lineage classifications:
