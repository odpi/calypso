/**
 * The ReferenceableStatus enum defines the status of an instance (classification, relationship or an entity) in the metadata collection.  It
 * effectively
 * defines its visibility to different types of queries.  Most queries by default will only return instances in the
 * active status.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Unknown: Unknown instance status.</li>
 *     <li>Draft: The content is incomplete.</li>
 *     <li>Proposed: The content is in review.</li>
 *     <li>Approved: The content is approved.</li>
 *     <li>Rejected: The request or proposal is rejected.</li>
 *     <li>Approved concept: The request or proposal is approved for development.</li>
 *     <li>Under development: The instance is being developed.</li>
 *     <li>Development complete: The development of the instance is complete.</li>
 *     <li>Approved for deployment: The instance is approved for deployment.</li>
 *     <li>StandBy: The instance is deployed in standby mode.</li>
 *     <li>Active: The instance is approved and in use.</li>
 *     <li>Failed: The instance is not in use due to failure.</li>
 *     <li>Disabled: The instance is shutdown or disabled.</li>
 *     <li>Complete: The activity associated with the instance is complete.</li>
 *     <li>Deprecated: The instance is out of date and should not be used.</li>
 *     <li>Other: The instance is in a locally defined state.</li>
 *     <li>Deleted: The instance has been deleted and is waiting to be purged.  It is kept in the metadata collection
 *     to support a restore request.  It is not returned on normal queries.</li>
