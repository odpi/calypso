## Dino User Interface

The Dino interface provides a way to visualize Egeria platforms, servers, the services they are running and the cohorts they have joined.

The Dino interface runs under the [Presentation Server](../../../../../README.md). 

The Dino interface delegates operations to the [Dino View Service](../../../../../../../view-services/rex-view/README.md).  in order to retrieve metadata.

For more general information about view services, see [View Services](../../../../../../../view-services/README.md).
