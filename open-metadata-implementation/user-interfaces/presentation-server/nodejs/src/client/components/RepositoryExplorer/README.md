## Repository Explorer User Interface

The Repository Explorer (Rex) interface provides a way to query Egeria metadata servers to retrieve and display about the metadata instances they contain. It is possible to retrieve entities and relationships, view their properties and display them as a graph of interconnected objects. 

The Repository Explorer (Rex) interface runs under the [Presentation Server](../../../../../README.md). 

The Repository Explorer (Rex) interface delegates operations to the [Repository Explorer (Rex) View Service](../../../../../../../view-services/rex-view/README.md).  in order to retrieve metadata.

For more general information about view services, see [View Services](../../../../../../../view-services/README.md).
