## Type Explorer User Interface

The Type Explorer (Tex) interface provides a way to explore the Egeria type system. It can be used to retrieve the types supported by a chosen server. The type information is then displayed both textually (on the left side) and diagrammatically (on the right side) with a choice of diagrams. One of the diagrams shows the entity inheritance tree and the other diagram shows the types of relationships that an entity type supports.


The Type Explorer (Tex) interface runs under the [Presentation Server](../../../../../README.md). 

The Type Explorer (Tex) interface delegates operations to the [Type Explorer (Rex) View Service](../../../../../../../view-services/tex-view/README.md) in order to retrieve metadata.

For more general information about view services, see [View Services](../../../../../../../view-services/README.md).
