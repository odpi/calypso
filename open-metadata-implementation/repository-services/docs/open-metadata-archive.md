# Open Metadata Archive

An open metadata archive is a document containing open metadata [type definitions](open-metadata-type-definitions.md)
and [instances](open-metadata-instances.md).

The open metadata archive has two uses:

* A **Content Pack**: reusable definitions that are generally useful.
* A **Metadata Export**: an export of metadata from a repository.  Used to transfer metadata
between repositories that are not connected to the same [cohort](open-metadata-repository-cohort.md).

Typically open metadata archives are encoded in JSON format and stored in a file.
However, both the format and storage method can be changed by changing the 
[open metadata archive connector](component-descriptions/connectors/open-metadata-archive-store-connector.md).

More information about open metadata archives can be found in the
[open-metadata-archives](../../../open-metadata-resources/open-metadata-archives) module.
