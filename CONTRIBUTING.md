# How to contribute

This project welcomes contributors from any organization or background, provided they are willing to follow the simple processes outlined below, as well as adhere to the Code of Conduct.

# Steps to contribute

* Review the coding guidelines
* Open an issue on JIRA to cover the proposed change ( if not done already )
* Clone the repository and prepare your contribution as a pull request
* Issue the PR, with the DCO signoff done
* Wait for a maintainer to review and approve the commit

# Why the DCO?

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the same approach — [the Developer’s Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/DCO1.1.txt) — that the [Linux® Kernel community](http://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin) uses to manage code contributions.

We simply ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer must include a sign-off statement in the commit message.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the submitter accepts the DCO:

<code>Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@hisdomain.com></code>

You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your local git repository using <code>git commit -s</code>.

# Getting a JIRA account and creating an issue
